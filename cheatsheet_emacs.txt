--Creating and Selecting Buffer--
C-x b buffer RET    		 Select or create a buffer named buffer (switch-to-buffer). 
C-x 4 b buffer RET    	 Similar, but select buffer in another window (switch-to-buffer-other-window). 
C-x 5 b buffer RET    	 Similar, but select buffer in a separate frame (switch-to-buffer-other-frame). 

--Killing Buffers--
C-x k bufname RET				Kill buffer bufname (kill-buffer).

--Marks--
Cx-Cx		to swap point (cursor) and mark
				When you... the mark is set to...
				C-spc						(where you are)				
				M< or M>				(where you were)
				Search for text	(where you started)
				Yank text	 			(start of inserted text)
				Insert a buffer	(start of inserted text)
				Move to a previous mark: C-u C-SPC
Select all: C-x h

--Search&Replace--
M-x query-replace = incrementally replace
C-s    Incremental search forward (isearch-forward). 
		C-s again to find next occurrence
		C-g to cancel and go back to start of search
		C-s C-s		Search for previously searched string
		C-s then M-p,M-n		Browse and edit previous queries
C-r    Incremental search backward (isearch-backward).
M-x 	 replace-regexp
		example:
		Bill Gates			->			GATES, Bill
		Steve Jobs			->			JOBS, Steve
		M-x replace-regexp \(\w+\) \(\w+\) with \,(upcase \2), \1

DIRectory EDitor (dired)
C-x d start up dired
C (large C) copy
d mark for erase
D delete right away
e or f open file or directory
g reread directory structure from file
G change group permissions (chgrp)
k delete line from listing on screen (don't actually delete)
m mark with *
n move to next line

u remove mark
v view file content
x delete files marked with D
z compress file
M-Del remove all marks (whatever kind)
~ mark backup files (name~ files) for deletion
# mark auto-save files (#name#) for deletion
*/ mark directory with * (C-u * removes that mark again)
= compare this file with marked file
M-= compare this file with it's backup file
! apply shell command to this file
M-} change to the next file marked with * od D
M-{ " previous "
% d mark files described through regular expression for deletion
% m " (with *)
+ create directory
> changed to next dir
< change to previous dir
s toggle between sorting by name or date

--define key-binding--
An easier way to figure out the key you need to specify for global/local-set-key is to use the kbd macro.
C-h c M-space –> M-SPC runs the command just-one-space
then simply use the key that it told you and wrap it with kbd.
(global-set-key (kbd "M-SPC") 'my-func)

Handy keybindings in haskell-mode. See the documentation C-h m for more information:

    * C-c C-= inserts an = sign and lines up type signatures and other pattern matches nicely.
    * C-c C-| inserts a guard
    * C-c C-o inserts a guard | otherwise = and lines up existing guards
    * C-c C-w inserts a where keyword
    * C-c C-. aligns code over a region in a "sensible" fashion. 

Now in version 2.2:

    * C-c C-t gets :type for symbol at point, and remembers it
    * C-u C-c C-t inserts a type annotation, for symbol at point, on the line above
    * C-c C-i gets :info for symbol at point
    * C-c M-. find definition of (interpreted) symbol at point
